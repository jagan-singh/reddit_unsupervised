They give you a card to track the shots you get. My nurse showed me how much they were injecting into you so you can visibly see. It didnt hurt getting injected in. They make you wait for 15minutes to make sure you don’t have a bad reaction. With my anxiety I ended up pacing in the back row to calm down because my mind likes to trick me into thinking something is wrong. 

Post shot: felt a little shaky but I’m not sure if it was due to my anxiety. Besides that, I felt fine. A few hours later my face felt feverish, but I had no fever. 
2nd day I only had the feverish face, sniffles, and injection sight pain. 

I’ve felt fine ever since! Second shot is on the 11th. To be honest, I didn’t read any information about the shot because I know I’d cause myself a panic attack after getting the shot😂. Still going strong though.",1609493056.0

Immune responses are not usually fun. I generally don’t feel well after most vaccines, but I assume that’s because my immune system is responding as expected. I’m young and generally healthy so I def get a stronger immune response than some. On the bright side, I’m probably covered now!

56,How the Covid mRNA vaccines work - a Santa Claus analogy,25,kjn0vv,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kjn0vv/how_the_covid_mrna_vaccines_work_a_santa_claus/,17,"There has been a lot of misinformation going around about the Covid vaccines currently being deployed, and a lot more good-intentioned skepticism.  Will the vaccine give you covid?  Will it make me sick?  Will it alter my DNA?  Most of this skepticism and fear is due to not simply not understanding how these vaccines actually work.  I thought I’d take a few paragraphs to try to put it into seasonally appropriate terms, using everyone’s favorite metaphor - Santa Claus.

Imagine your cells are Santa’s workshop.

Santa is your DNA, and he works in his office in the middle of the workshop. The nucleus.

Outside of his office, the workshop is full of tiny little elves, also known as your ribosomes.

Santa has a big book of toy schematics, and as Christmas approaches he makes copies of designs from this book, or mRNA, and sends them out of his office to his elves.

His elves use these designs to make toys.  The toys then get sent out of the workshop to be distributed among the children of the world.

The children are your immune system.

Children, of course, know a good toy when they see one.  They watch commercials, they see ads, they have the YouTube.  So when they see a Barbie, or a GI joe, or a baby yoda doll, or a PS5 they recognize it and greedily welcome it into their home.

But one day someone sneaks a design for brussel sprouts into Santa’s workshop. The mRNA vaccine.

It stays out of his office, so it never makes it into Santa’s book, and the old man is none the wiser.

But outside on the factory floor, the elves get a hold of it, and since it looks like any other toy design, they start churning brussel sprouts out by the thousands.  They then place them onto Santa’s sleigh, where he deposits them into stockings all over the world.

But when the kids of the world upend their stockings and a few brussel sprouts roll out, they sense something is wrong.

They reject the brussel sprouts.  They attack the brussel sprouts.  They stomp on them, they crush them in their creepy little fists, they throw them at the cats. (The cats are representative of nothing in my analogy, they just had it coming)

Most importantly, since the kids like to use the TikTok, they record video snippets of this travesty which disseminate around the world.   It takes a while for the word to spread, but eventually it does, and next time the kids of the world see a brussel sprout, they will be ready.

TikTok is your T-Cells.

Now, since the children of the world have been made wise, the next time mom and dad try to serve up brussel sprouts, their kids will recognize the devil’s cabbage, cleverly hidden between the meatloaf and the potatoes, and promptly throw the whole plate across the room at the cat.

That’s basically - no, that’s EXACTLY how these mRNA vaccines work.  They introduce small pieces of RNA into the cell, and the cell uses that to churn out copies of the “spike protein” which stud the envelope of the coronavirus.  The vaccine RNA is then broken down by the cell and goes away.  It never enters the nucleus, and never even sees your DNA let alone alters it, and though it makes a piece of a protein on the coronavirus, it neither uses a virus to enter your cells, nor makes any intact virus which could make you sick.  But since it does make that protein, and alerts your immune system to its presence, the next time your body sees it on the outer envelope of a coronavirus, it throws the whole virus at the cat.

We are not going to see the end of this pandemic until roughly 70% of us are immune to covid.  If that immunity is obtained through infection, it will likely be short-lived, and gained at the expense of millions of lives.  Not an option.  The only option is vaccination.  For vaccination to work, at least about 70% of us need to take the vaccine.  That means, technically, 30% of us can skip it and ride along on the coattails of those who were vaccinated.  But if 50% of us decide to be the 30%, we all lose.  That’s why, even though you might not want to take the vaccine, you should take the vaccine.  You may not like it, but sometimes you just have to eat your brussel sprouts.",1608873447.0

I was held 15 mins after the shot to make sure everything was okay. It went well and I went about my day. About 4 hours later, I def felt the my L deltoid sore..

Wed was a little weird. I had a headache around noon. Very light headache. 3/10 4/10. I’m not sure if because I didn’t have my coffee or whatnot but I did feel it.

Fast forward around 9, maaaan!! I was exhausted, I was helping my wife fold some clothes and I just knocked out on the chair with the baby socks on my hand.. I usually play basketball, every other Saturday and after playing, I feel very very exhausted..

This exhaustion I felt, felt like I was playing basketball. It was so weird..

I woke up today, felt completely fine. Point of Injection is not sore. Maybe 1-2/10..

I work at the hospital and have a 4 month old baby. Past 2 weeks I probably got tested twice due contract tracing. I tested both negative(thank you Jesus)

58,Vaccinated Symbol?,1,kjwyo7,CovidVaccine,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccine/comments/kjwyo7/vaccinated_symbol/,8,"I apologize in advance if I'm posting to the wrong sub. 

Has any thought been put into some obvious outward symbol to show someone has recieved the covid vaccine? (arm band, ribbon, bumber sticker on forehead)

If not, I'm thinking black bandana or arm band over the arm that was injected (easy enough people  would do it, odd enough to draw attention, and specifically black to recognize those that died or have life altering health complications from covid). 

This idea took me less time than writing this post! Please somebody come up with something better!

I know this sounds silly now, depending on where you live, but I think it's necessary in some places.  

I live in the US, in an apartment complex housing a few anti-maskers (covid deniers) and a lot of people who wear masks on their chins (like why even bother?)

I have high hopes of getting both doses of a covid vaccine in the next 3 to 24 months (US politicians have been wrong a lot recently) but after I'm vaccinated, and maskless, I don't want people to think ""Oh we got that mask wearing fool on our side, I'll never get the vaccine!!!""

I'm also not particularly against continuing to wear a mask AFTER  I'm fully vaccinated for solidarity with the not yet vaccinated, and to keep being the mask wearing fool my neighbors make fun off. But I (and others?) would appreciate a simple, recognizable symbol of being vaccinated.

For anyone wondering, the covid vaccines (plural) have been proven to work, or else governmental health agencies wouldn't be distributing them, (they could have been injecting us with bleach in March, if they just wanted to kill their citizens).

Please don't argue with me about if the vaccines work or masks are effective or if covid is real. You won't change my mind so it's a waste of your time. A brick wall could be better persuaded.",1608920765.0

Received the Pfizer vaccine in left deltoid. Barely felt the needle - less painful than a flu shot! No side effects / reactions noted immediately or within the 15 minute observation window.

Monday, 12/21, 8pm
Felt some tingling in my arms and in my head, almost like a daze - no headache as others reported. No injection site pain, swelling, or warmth at all. Took a nap and tingling was gone when I woke up about an hour later.

Tuesday, 12/22, 9am
Began experiencing very mild muscle spasms and twitches around left deltoid (injected arm). Nothing too serious or bothersome. Went away after about 10 minutes. Felt a very little bump at the injection site. Still no pain or warmth.

Tuesday, 12/22, 8pm
Could barely stay awake after dinner. Could be that I was tired after 12 hours of work, but ended up taking a huge 2 hour nap.

Wednesday, 12/23, 5pm
Began getting body aches all over - neck, back, fingers, legs - sort of what you’d feel like if you have a fever or are sick. Kind of fatigued and lethargic. Continued into the night but slowly trickling down. Can’t feel the lump anymore. Still no pain.

Thursday, 12/24, 7am
Body aches and fatigue went away. Started to get some cold sweats - but could also be from running around at work. Otherwise I’m fine.

Thursday, 12/24, 1pm
Chills and cold sweats persisted, but no fever or other symptoms. I got a rapid covid test to be safe and it was negative. Waiting on PCR results probably by Sunday. Starting to assume it’s just another delayed reaction from the vaccine. Have heard other people report similar delayed experiences, along with sniffles and just feeling sick.

Thursday, 12/24, 7pm
Cold sweats gone once I got home at 3pm. Wonder if it was my work environment or it just ran its course and it’s a coincidence. Occasional chills but much better than before. House could also be a bit cold.

Friday, 12/25, 6am
Seems like I’m back to normal. Started developing a headache about 10 hours into my 12 hour shift (4pm) but could’ve been dehydration and just being tired.

Question: Did anyone else who got the Pfizer vaccine NOT experience any injection site pain? I know a lot of people who got sore arms or tenderness, and I usually do too with the flu shot, but nothing with the COVID vaccine.

I don’t seem to be able to piece the information together. I am trying to figure out how many doses of the vaccine have been secured by the US. We started with 100 million doses of Pfizer secured and just secured 100 million more by the end of July. Plus 10 million Moderna by the end of 2020. But, how much more Moderna can we expect and when?

With a population of roughly 330 million people, it looks like we have enough for about 1/3 of the population to receive both doses. More Moderna could change this, but does anyone have numbers on that? I’m curious about when we have enough to get to 70% of the population so that we can get to some level of herd immunity.

Like the majority of people here I work at a hospital and was able to receive the first shot of the vaccine today. We all made appointments so it took less than five minutes from check in to injection. Hurt less than the flu vaccine, hardly felt it! Prior to check in we received an information packet, a consent form, and a registration sheet with a QR code that is basically a health tracker to monitor our experience after for the CDC. If you register with this health tracker they will ask for you for updates every day and if you have any side effects so they can accurately monitor them. 

After injection of we waited inside the clinic for 15 minutes for the nurses to monitor any immediate reactions. We received a follow up appointment for our second shot at this time that is 19-23 days from the first dose (mine is 21 days from now). 

(We paid nothing for the vaccine)

First, a bit of background - I work at a fairly large but rural hospital in Texas. We received our first supply of the Pfizer vaccine (currently inconveniently named ""BNT162b2"") on Monday and began vaccinating our healthcare employees on Tuesday, December 15. The vaccine is considered voluntary, and employees are not forced to get the vaccine to continue working. Previously, employees filled out a survey where we could opt in for the vaccine. Even after opting in, employees had the option to change their mind up until they received their shot. Suffice to say, I decided to go all the way. I've been cautiously optimistic about the vaccine for a while, and aside from seasonal allergies, I have a fairly unremarkable medical history. Also, when the nursing department said that there would be free lollipops... well, that sealed the deal for me.

Our hospital set up pre-planned COVID vaccination times to keep things organized, and I showed up to my 3:15PM slot a few minutes early since I half-expected to see a cluster-F. I was a little disappointed to see that things were actually pretty mellow. There was a check-in process that involved filling out a one-page consent form with a 6-page easy-to-read primer on the vaccine, COVID-19, and potential side effects; TLDR = You're getting two 30 mcg shots 21-days apart. 

They also introduced a CDC app, V-Safe, that would send us a weekly survey to ask for side-effects. They encouraged us to report any side effect of any intensity on the survey, whether it was severe or just minor arm pain. V-Safe is completely optional and voluntary, and they said we could get the vaccine without worrying about V-Safe.

The check-in process took about 5 minutes total; faster than I expected. They asked me which arm should receive the vaccine, and I picked left since I've never liked that arm. When they pulled out the vaccine syringe, I realized that I was suddenly a tad nervous. When I get nervous, I talk a lot. I talked about how small the needle looked; I compared it to a flu shot needle. I talked about how the vaccine syringe had a translucent semi-clear off-white look to it. The syringe itself looked really narrow and innocuous. After talking about the syringe, I talked about how I talk a lot when I get nervous. While talking, I spotted the bowl of lollipops and talked about those too. At some point in my monologue, the nurse saw her window, nodded at me for permission, and I frowned and nodded back. 

The actual injection was extremely unremarkable. I expected a stinging sharpness, but instead it felt more like a dull, numbing sort of discomfort. I was worried that the actual liquid would be extra viscous or acidic, and as the nurse was injecting me I was fearful that it would be like that one year where the flu shot with the H1N1 strain really sucked and caused a sore arm right after. But, instead, I felt more surprised by how much the injection itself didn't hurt. I wasn't even sure that I had gotten the vaccine until later when I saw a small dot of dried blood on my bandaid.

After the shot, they hand you a small vaccination card that shows the date and location of your 1st shot, and it reminds you that you still have to get a 2nd shot after 21 days. I noticed that the day of the vaccination is being counted as Day 0 and so tomorrow is Day 1. After the shot, they had me sit in a waiting room for 15 minutes to watch for an allergic reaction. They even handed me a placard that read ""You must wait until 3:35PM"" before I could leave observation. I took this time to sign up for V-Safe (which took about 2 minutes), text some friends, and then stare out the window before I was free to go back to work.

As I'm typing this post, it's been about 6.5 hours since I've gotten the vaccine, and I haven't noticed any unusual pain or side-effects yet. From the NEJM article about the vaccine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577), I'm preparing myself for some combination of a headache and/or fatigue, and I wouldn't be surprised if my arm hurts more in the morning As of right now, though, I haven't noticed anything out of place in my body unless I stop to focus on my arm and ask, ""Does my arm hurt at all?"" and, I guess the answer to that is, ""Yeah, I guess it qualifies as a 1 out of 10 on the discomfort scale."" It hasn't limited any of my activities at this point, and I've been able to jog, do some pull-ups and light exercise without any problems. It's been extremely mundane so far, and my only real angst right now is that I forgot to pick up a lollipop on my way out of observation. But, I'm also trying to stay cautious and remind myself that stuff can still happen either in the next few days or with the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. Still, I'm a bit relieved with how things have gone so far.

I hope my experience has provided a data point for you guys about the literal vaccination process. If you guys have any questions about my experience, feel free to ask and I'll see if I can provide something useful.


**Update 1 - Post-Vaccine Day 1, Dec 17**

TLDR - Pretty boring so far. Arm is slightly more painful, and I had a fake headache.

The left arm pain is a bit more noticeable today. I'm bumping the pain scale on my left deltoid from 1 to 2, and when I raise arm over my head (sorta like I'm flapping my wings), the pain increases to a 3. It's still not enough to limit any functionality. For comparison, I asked for ""spicy"" chicken biriyani from a local Indian place, and I would rate that as a 5 on the pain scale. Feel free to ask me to rate other stuff on the pain scale, and I'll try my best calibrate for perspective.

I half-expected to have a headache this morning, and so when I woke up, I focused on the idea for a few minutes, and it felt like I had a dull sort-of-there-but-not-quite headache sitting somewhere in the back of my head. But, when I thought about it some more, I realized that I only got 5 hours of sleep (work-related reasons), and being short on sleep usually gives me a slight-minor-headache that fades over time. By the time I got to work, I had plowed a cup of coffee down my throat, and I didn't notice a headache for the rest of the day. Looking back on that, I think I had convinced myself that I was going to have a headache based on the NEJM study and what some coworkers had warned. I'm going to say that my headache was really more due to sleep deprivation and coffee dependency as opposed to being from the vaccine. 

Also, in my original post, I said the V-Safe vaccine survey was a weekly surveillance program. Well, apparently I misunderstood and it's actually a daily survey for 5 weeks. I know this because I got a text message reminding me to fill out my daily survey at 2PM. Fortunately, all of the questions are multiple choice, and it takes about 1-2 minutes to get through the entire thing. I rated the arm pain as an injection-site pain, and I did the whole thing while walking from the restroom back to my desk. 

In all, aside from the arm pain, I haven't noticed anything unusual so far. It's still early, though, so I'm reminding myself that something could still happen in the next few days. And, if not that, then maybe something will happen with Shot #2 in ~21 days. We'll see, and I'll try to update this post even if nothing happens in the interim.


**Update 2 - Post-Vaccine Day 2, December 18**

The left arm pain is just about gone. I would say it's back to a 1 out of 10, and I don't even notice it unless I have the arm raised. I'm still doing pull-ups, and I think I'm going to stop mentioning them because 1.) They haven't been a problem, and 2.) I'm starting to sound like a bro.

Still no headache. And, I haven't really noticed any fatigue from the vaccine, but that might be obfuscated by the fact that it's my 12-day stretch at work, and I'm on autopilot at this point. I'm leaning hard on the caffeine as part of my usual long-stretch routine, and you know what? It works. 

No stomach upset, diarrhea, or problems peeing yet. I do have a craving for sushi right now, but that happens monthly for me. 

I did want to add that I've been wearing a Fitbit and Garmin, and my heart rate has stayed at its normal range post-vaccine which is like 60'ish at rest. Also, my O2 saturation hasn't changed either; it's been in the 96+% range so far. And, yes, I actually wear both a Fitbit and a Garmin at the same time. 

I'm going to keep posting updates up until Day 7 for the sake of record keeping, but if nothing happens by then, I'll stop updating this post. I'm sure I'm jinxing something by writing that.


**Update 3 - Post-Vaccine Day 3 - December 19**

My left arm pain at the site of injection is gone now. I'd say it's back to 100%. Still no issues with headaches, fatigue, or a fever. But, I did have two small developments today that I'm keeping an eye on. 

1.) While picking up some acne cream from the pharmacy this afternoon, the screening lady at the door told me I had a temp of 99.6. I was caught a little off-guard since I didn't feel off ( subjective fever, headache, or body aches). On the way out, I used the automated scanner that reads facial/eye temperature, and it gave me a 97.6. I'm not sure what to think about that yet. It's bedtime now, and I don't feel feverish still, but I'm going to reserve judgment and keep an eye on my temp for the next few days. 

2.) Remember how I mentioned I was getting the sushi shakes? Well, after running 11 miles this evening (a long distance for me), I decided to reward myself with all-you-can-eat sushi for dinner. Right after sitting down at the restaurant and salivating for a minute, I felt this  lightheadedness creep into the back of my head and then into my forehead. I feel sweat beading up on my forehead, and then I got all tingly on my hands, and my vision tunneled in. I tried to rally my sushi appetite, but it was gone. I got up, wobbled to my car, and laid down. After a few minutes, I felt good again, and I drove to Chipotle with a swell of sushiless shame in the pit of my stomach. 

I'm still deliberating if any of that was related to the vaccine. After everything happened, I thought about what could have caused those symptoms. Somehow, the first thought I had was whether or not I was pregnant (I'm a guy). Then, I thought about how the vaccine was the only recent new thing in my life. But, the delayed timeline and the sudden and temporary nature seem out of place. 

Thinking strictly about the symptoms, this feels more like dehydration and malnourishment. I hadn't eaten anything all day in preparation for the sushi buffet (which I missed out on altogether). And, it occurred to me that I was drinking lots of water at Chipotle without needing to pee. I also felt 100% better after I obliterated my burrito bowl. 

Still, a part of me wonders if the vaccine played a role. Maybe it was a constellation of things adding up, and I need to just take it a little more easy for the next week.


**Update 4 - Post-Vaccine Day 4 - Dec. 20**


Nothing exciting to report today. I didn't notice any dizziness or lightheaded today, so I'm going to say last night's event was probably due to dehydration and no food intake.

I haven't noticed any body pains or body pains, and I haven't felt limited in any way today. Hopefully it stays this way.


**Update 5 - Post-Vaccine Day 5 - Dec. 21**

Originally, I thought the 2nd vaccine shot had to come exactly 21 days after the first. Apparently, though, we can schedule our second shot to happen anywhere between 17-21 days after the first. I have my second vaccine shot scheduled for January 3, which will be Day 18 for me. 

The general consensus is that side effects will be more likely with the second shot. And, using the NEJM article that I linked in my first post, the top three side effects will be fatigue, headache, and fever (though, fever is a distant 3rd in probability). My boss offered to give me a day off after my 2nd vaccine shot, but I told him that I was okay plowing my face into work the next day. I intend on drinking a ton of coffee that day...

As for how I'm feeling today, I can't say that I have any complaints. I haven't noticed anything new for today, and really I'm just feeling tired because I've been sleeping late (working on some stuff for work). I'm not suffering from insomnia, though. I sleep like a brick once my head hits the pillow. Speaking of which...


Update 6 - Poat-Vaccine Day 6 - Dec. 22

I went to my  physical therapy appointment today (related to a pelvic fracture from earlier in the year). It's usually a pretty hefty workout. I didn't have any problems with arm pain cropping up, and I didn't notice any fatigue that inhibited my PT. It's a bit reassuring that there isn't some sort of latent side effect or residual pain from the shot that's holding me back.

On all, nothing fancy today. I really haven't felt anything related to the vaccine since maybe Day 2.",1608207713.0

If natural immunity won’t work how will a vaccine?
Like from what I read, the thought is getting the virus doesnt make you immune because your body won’t remember the antibody for a mild case
But that’s exactly how a vaccine works- isn’t it?
From Googling: A vaccine works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. To do this, certain molecules from the pathogen must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response.

I don't think people will turn to Zeds or die or some shit, I just feel like people are being injected with Corona itself. Honestly no different than just catching it regularly it seems; since vaccines aren't supposed to work like that.

If I am correct, and feel free to prove me wrong, vaccines are supposed to send the controlled version of the virus in so your body has more of a fighting chance at learning how to deal. So, why do symptoms sound so similar..?

I’ve had pretty bad anaphylaxis reactions before, hopes dashed, guess this isn’t for me. Oh well, they’re making more. 

Now they have approved this Oxford vaccine.

Me: Female, 39 yrs old, overall healthy, slightly overweight, fairly active

Other info/possible factors:

* Anemic + currently on period
* Low sleep (\~4-6 hrs/sleep daily for past week- due to bad time management/life)
* Take daily OTC antacids (Pepcid, Nexium)

Timeline/symptoms:

Tuesday @ 10am- receive 1st dose of Moderna Vaccine. Did not hurt. Arm was barely tender at injection site.

Tuesday \~ 5pm- started to feel sharp noticeable headache, slowly faded, went away by midnight.

Wednesday @ 7am- reported to work, felt fine, entire upper arm sore, passed indoor temp check.

9:30am- started to sweat, which is rare unless I'm being extremely active. Felt fine otherwise. Was in light PPE (N95 mask & face shield). Thought maybe I over dressed.

10:15am- started feeling very warm, still felt ok, noticed increase in sweat, a few minutes into a heavy sweat that came on quickly. Reported to manager, requested a temp check just incase.

10:20am- temp was 101.4!, did not feel feverish other than sweat/hot. Felt zero malaise. Told to go home & self monitor. Doffed, immediately started feeling cooler. Walked to car about 1/2 mile outside in cool weather. Felt totally comfortable by the time I got to my car.

10:45am- got home, waited 10 minutes, took temp, it was normal (97.2).

Checked temp a few times throughout the day, never higher than 97.7

No more sudden quick sweat or fevers. No chills. No headache. Have felt tired since this morning, but lack of sleep easily explains that.

Around 12pm noticed injection site has raised/red, still sore arm.

Today I received my shot. Again, this trial is 2-1 blind, so 66% chance I got the vaccine vs placebo. It's been a few hours now and no issues other than getting your standard shot. Little sore, but that's it.

I think some may enjoy hearing how this process works and also to put anyone's mind at ease that thinks this stuff is rushed (though I doubt anyone that subs here thinks that).

First, the pre-screen was exhaustive. We covered my medical history, family history, medications I'm on, medications I plan to take, upcoming Dr visits, work history, etc.... After all of that, I had my vitals taken, then a quick physical from a Dr. Finally, after everything, I had blood drawn, then was given my shot. You then have to wait 30min to leave.

Every night you have to answers questions in an eDiary app on your phone. You have to document everything. Reactions, how you feel, etc... You also have to notify them of literally any medecine you take (yea, that includes Tylenol for a headache).  If you feel ill, they provided at home Covid-19 swabs that you use, then they send a courier to pick them up and test you.

At the end of the day, the process is insanely thorough. The thought that ANY adverse reactions may slip through or go unnoticed is just plain wrong.  

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to answer them all.

(sorry for any typos, I'm on my Phone)",1609389263.0

Other than working at the hospital, I have been a hermit since this all began. Literally. I'm so excited for there to be a light at the end of the tunnel with these vaccines. I did my research before deciding to get it and I'm so happy to have some sort of protection now. 🙌🏼

I got the shot about 3pm on 12/29. Its now 6am on 12/31. The shot didn't even slightly hurt. As a matter of fact I barely felt anything! By the time I left work at 5pm, my arm was slightly sore. That night the soreness got progressively worse. It was pretty dang tender and I kept raising my arm like a little broken wing at my husband. He said ""It's okay love... your arm is just fighting Covid right now!"" 🤣 No other real symptoms, until about 3am when I woke up with an headache until I finally got up and took some aspirin. Eventually I fell back to sleep. When I woke up at 6am a slight headache was still there but and my arm felt less sore (although that might have been the pain reliever because the soreness came back later.) I felt a little fatigued throughout the morning but by afternoon that all subsided and since then I'm just left with my little sore arm.

I am so grateful to have received this vaccine and and had such mild side effects so far. Mentally it feels like a weight has been lifted just knowing that I have some protection against this now. I feel so bad for those that have had loved ones die alone unable to breathe in the hospital. To me that sounds like the saddest way to go and lose a loved one and that has terrified me and kept me home. I can't wait until a good majority are vaccinated and people can feel safe again.

235,Previous vaccine Non-Responder,8,kluwfo,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/kluwfo/previous_vaccine_nonresponder/,7,"Hello all!

Please chime in if you have legitimate knowledge.

I am a healthcare worker who received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine roughly 30 hours ago. Other than a sore bicep, I have had zero side effects (yay!). Some other things to note: I have fibromyalgia and I was very concerned that the list of known side effects are basically my daily life in a nutshell, so I was expecting to feel as I normally do, only MUCH worse, so I was actually very surprised that I feel as well as I do. Sure, my head hurts a bit, my muscles ache, my joints ache, but yea... this is my baseline so as far as I am concerned, I have had no side effects. At my hospital entrance screening my temperature read a blazing 95 degrees? Which made me feel like they should recalibrate their thermometers, but I could tell I didn’t even have an elevated temperature after my vaccination.

Now onto my question: I have had multiple rounds of the MMR vaccination and I have had blood titers afterward and I show absolutely no antibodies for MMR. So, as I have been told, I am what they call a “vaccine non-responder” to that immunization specifically.

This makes me wonder. Could I potentially be a non-responder to the COVID vaccine? Is that why my body has reacted in the same way that it would as if I had water injected into my muscle? Most people are at least spiking a bit of a fever? I mean, you should. It’s expected. You almost want your body to wake up a bit and do SOMETHING with this vaccine. I am a bit worried that I haven’t responded at all. I want some fricken antibodies. You know?

Anyone have any insight? I’ve tried to do some research. I mean it, I’ve really tried. It’s all so confusing to me.

Thank you for your time!!",1609205808.0

For the first 24 hours I only had a sore arm, similar to a flu shot. Since Thursday night however I have felt extra tired, have been getting hot flashes, and headaches. Today my shoulders both began to feel sore. 

If this has been caused by the vaccine, it is more than bearable. I do find it interesting though that 5 days later I am still having side effects. Anyone else experience this? 

If it continues I will get tested just to make sure I didn’t happen to get infected around the same time.",1609187743.0

19 hours out - Very sore left arm, slight headache behind my eyes, fatigue but that could be a Benadryl hangover. I took Benadryl 25 mg (and another at bedtime), Pepcid 20 MG, and brought my EpiPen and albuterol inhaler. I have to say though, Optum did a great job monitoring people.

I didn't hear any horns honking while I waited!

30 hours out - Wow, crazy fatigue, full body aches, and sore arm. I want to lay here in my bed and not move. Glad to be making an immune response. Haven't taken any OTC analgesics. Riding the wave.

“We want to keep the study blinded for as long as possible, right now we are unblinding individuals on a case by case basis only if they are actively and currently being offered the Moderna/Pfizer vaccine (frontline healthcare workers and providers). At this time, because the J&J vaccine is not approved for EUA by the FDA, we would not be able to vaccinate those in the placebo group with the Janssen vaccine once they become unblinded. Pending EUA approval we will have a clearer plan from our sponsor what the unblinding process would look like, and we will notify all participants of this at that time.

[Source](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-covid-vaccine-terminated-due-to-hiv-false-positives-20201210-p56mju.html)

 A billion-dollar deal for the Morrison government to buy more than 50 million doses of the University of Queensland's potential coronavirus vaccine has been abruptly terminated after several trial participants returned false positive HIV test results.  


A source with knowledge of the clinical results said although the HIV protein fragment posed ""Absolutely no health risk to people"", they had identified that some trial participants who received the vaccine produced a partial antibody response to it.  


Related Article A volunteer takes part in trials of UQ's vaccine candidate in July.  


Explainer Coronavirus pandemic How crucial was the UQ-CSL vaccine to Australia and what options do we now have? The partial antibody response had the potential to interfere with some HIV screening tests that look for the antibodies - leading to a false positive test result.  


Evidence publicly released so far from the clinical trials found the vaccine to be safe and said it produced a strong immune response able to neutralise the COVID-19 virus in laboratory based tests.  


Related Article ""This outcome highlights the risk of failure associated with early vaccine development."": CSL chief scientific officer Andrew Nash Breaking Coronavirus pandemic CSL says vaccine trial outcome highlights 'risk of failure' with early development Neither CSL, the University of Queensland nor the Morrison government would comment when contacted by this masthead. Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, but scientists around the world are racing to produce a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine by next year.  


Researchers are testing 58 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and at least 86 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation in animals.

318,Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine trial first hand,17,k9hyig,CovidVaccinated,https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/k9hyig/johnson_johnson_covid_vaccine_trial_first_hand/,11,"I signed up to participate in an unnamed vaccine trial in mid November. After Thanksgiving I got an email from IQVIA to schedule a screening. 

I went to some temporary buildings in a hospital parking lot.  I was given a stack of papers to read which clarified that I was participating in the Johnson and Johnson trial. I was happy to read that as the vaccine, while a bit behind the front runners, has a lot going for it. It’s easier to store and transport and only requires one jab. 

I found out that I get paid to participate. I wasn’t expecting that. After screening, vaccination, and first follow up, I get $375. Then it’s about $150 each follow up after that. If you catch COVID you get paid even more for letting them track you. 

The study is supposed to last two years but you can opt out to get an approved vaccine. They said if participants want to get an approved shot they should call the trial. They will unblind you so you can know whether you got the placebo or are already vaccinated. It looks like they will schedule a final appointment to gather a last set of data prior to exiting the study. I did not see or hear anything about being guaranteed a vaccine at some point in the future. Others have reported this though. I may have missed it. 

After reading through it all they drew three vials of blood and gave me a COVID test. There was a quick assessment of BP, O2, and heart rate. And then I waited.  After about 45 minutes I got my injection.  They observed me for 15 minutes and I was released. Total time was about 2 hours 40 minutes. 

I had no soreness, fever, or fatigue, which they said were typical side effects. I couldn't even tell where the needle went in. I'm pretty sure I got the placebo (saline). It's been four days and nothing happened.  I'm disappointed but half the folks weren't going to get the real thing. And some people have completely asymptomatic responses to the vaccine, just like the virus itself, so you never know. 

All said I'd do it again. It was not a bad experience. Considering what a lot of others are doing to get us through this, it's a small thing.",1607506269.0

TL;DR: As of now, I feel fine, no real side effects to report. I think I got the placebo. 

Earlier this week, I filled out the form to volunteer for the Ensemble study by Jannsen, for their 1-shot vaccine candidate. I assume that it’s due to my unique demographic (Hispanic LGBTQ woman in her early 40s) that I got a call within hours. After some questions, they asked me if I would want to participate and receive either the trial vaccine or the placebo. I wanted to do my small part in helping to get us all out of this pandemic, so I said yes. 

Two days later, I’m in a waiting room at my local hospital’s clinical trials offices. After going over how I’d have to fill out a medical diary 2x a week, along with a filling out & signing LOTS of forms, the nurse eventually came in & gave me my shot (flu shot style, in the non-dominant arm). 

Now, I’m a day and a half out from the shot and, so far, I’ve experienced no major side effects. I’ve had a tiny headache and felt a little tired this morning - nothing a nap and some Advil couldn’t handle. Since I’ve had no soreness or pain at the injection site, I think I got the placebo. I won’t know for sure until the study is unblinded.

To help with the effort, I tried to volunteer for different Phase 3 trials.  To make it to phase 3, the vaccines need to show they are producing antibodies and not have serious side effects for people.  After 3 attempts, I was selected to participate in the Johnson & Johnson ENSEMBLE trial vaccine.

After getting final approval after the screening process, including a medical history and some blood tests, I got the shot. 

Everybody's reactions to the vaccines are different, so I would like to share some of my experiences.  I get the flu vaccine every year and have almost no reaction.  Earlier this year I had the Shingrix shingles vaccine and it hurt at the injection with moderate pain for a short time then mild pain for a couple of days.  I had mild discomfort when I lied on my shoulder the first night, then things got better.  The toughest vaccine for me is the tetanus shot.  That shot makes me feel like I got punched in the shoulder and hurts for 2 or 3 days.  I'd say my pain last time was 5 or 6 out of 10.  Hopefully that will provide a reference for my experience with the COVID vaccine.

When I received the COVID shot, immediately I felt mild pain in my shoulder.  It radiated out a little further than the Tetnus shot did, including my jaw and chest and peaked at a moderate level for a few minutes at about a 5 out of 10 scale.  Not pleasant, but not too bad.  Also, I started to feel like I was getting a mild cold, but never developed a temperature.

I'm now at day 2 still feel some mild symptoms like I'm getting a cold.  I occasionally feel mild pain around the injection site, jaw and behind the shoulder blade.  Per the information, these are the common, expected side effects.  They let you take Advil or other pain relievers to help with the symptoms.  I'm hopeful that this is a sign my body is still working hard to develop anti-bodies.

I had a 50/50% chance to get the vaccine or a saline solution placebo.  Based on my reactions after the shot, I probably got the real vaccine. 

There are two positive things about the J&J vaccine that I hope can help a lot of people.  First, it works with only 1 shot.  Their presentation material advised that 99% of the people in earlier trials developed anti-bodies.  The purpose of this trial is to confirm actual  %% efficacy rate is for protecting against COVID.   Second, it doesn't need to ultra cold temperatures that the other leading vaccines require.  This can help for areas that don't have the special refrigeration and help more people get access to the vaccine.

Nobody is sure how long the vaccines will last, but these types of studies will help answer the question.  

Stay safe everyone.",1606885892.0

Maybe you didn\`t noticed but lot of discussions about vaccines now. As we know many people are sceptic, because longterm effects are unknown at that time. So my question is if someone funded here know how many vaccines was abandoned so far in research because they shows as dangerous in long term side effects  ? I think this stat could also help form the opinion about vaccines. Because if it was 2% or 60% that makes a difference I think. I know mRNA is completely new but anyway.  
EDIT: I mean all vaccines at all, not only for covid.

Disclosure of information on the first weeks, the origins of the virus , the hoarding of PPE in December and January, the virology lab in Wuhan, the traveling for Chinese New Years. 

In the coming months and years much will be discussed and investigated. 

How do you feel about China right now?
